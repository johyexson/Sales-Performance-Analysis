# Case Study
A manufacturing company is a corporation that specializes in the production of satchet and bottled water wants to analyse its production and sales record in order to determine sales growth and pinpoint areas that require improvements in their production techniques.
# Data Overview
The dataset was provided by an actual manufacturing company. However, for this project I used a simulation of the dataanalysis in order to ensure privacy protection.
# Tools
- Excel
- [PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMGRiNjVmMTQtNTM5Ni00YzZhLWI4NDEtZDUwZmNhYjYwMTE3IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9)
# Analysis Methods
- Cleaned and transformed data in Excel 
- Processed and analyzed data to develop insights that can help solve the business problem
- Created graphs using Tableau to visualize the results
- Developed a dashboard using Power BI
# Graphs
Key questions regarding the sales record were answered in the visualized results as seen below:
* What does the sales growth per week depict?

* What is the sales trend for each week?

* How does sale performance vary by each day of the week?

# Summary of Findings
- Printed rolls incurred the highest expenses in terms of production cost for December 2023
- The first and third week recorded a high increase in sales at the rate of 81% and 54% respectively showing positive improvement in sales growth
- The third week was the most productive as zero naira was spent on production while sales performance almost doubled the amount of the previous week
- Weekly sales trend show that there was consistent increase in sales performance across the week, accounting for the 31% profit margin ðŸ“ˆ accumulated in December
# Recommendations 
- Employ strategies to effectively minimise cost of production
- Printed roll is an important tool for production that should be properly managed to help reduce expenses
