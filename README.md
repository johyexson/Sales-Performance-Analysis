# Introduction
Haladex Water Production Company is a corporation that specializes in the manufacturing and production of satchet and bottled water. During my quest to volunteer as a data analyst for production companies in order to gain hands-on experience in the field, I got a referral from a company I once volunteered for and I was approached by Haladex's manager who expressed interest in having me analyse their sales records
# Business Task
Analyse production and sales record in order to determine sales growth and give recommendations on areas of improvement in production techniques
# Data Source
The dataset which contained the company sales record were provided by the manager of the company. However, for this project I did a simulation of the analysis I carried out using the company data in order to ensure privacy protection.
# Tools
- Excel
- [PowerBI](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMGRiNjVmMTQtNTM5Ni00YzZhLWI4NDEtZDUwZmNhYjYwMTE3IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9)
- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joy.johnson5229/viz/HaladexWaterProductionAnalysis/Dashboard1)
# Methods
- Cleaned and transformed data in Excel 
- Processed and analyzed data to develop insights that can help solve the business problem
- Created graphs using Tableau to visualize the results
- Developed a dashboard using PowerBI 
# Graphs
Key questions regarding the sales record were answered in the visualized results as seen below:
* What does the sales growth per week depict?

# Summary of Findings
- Printed rolls incurred the highest expenses in terms of production cost for December 2023
- The first and third week recorded a high increase in sales at the rate of 81% and 54% respectively showing positive improvement in sales growth
- The third week was the most productive as zero naira was spent on production while sales performance almost doubled the amount of the previous week
- Weekly sales trend show that there was consistent increase in sales performance across the week, accounting for the 31% profit margin 📈 accumulated in December
# Recommendations 
- Employ strategies to effectively minimise cost of production
- Printed roll is an important tool for production that should be properly managed to help reduce expenses
# Limitations
- Inability to access customer data due to privacy policy
- Inadequate data management and improper bookkeeping method resulting to limited availability of data
